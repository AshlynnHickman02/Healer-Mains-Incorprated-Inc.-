-Ana Amari-
Ana’s Biotic Rifle and Biotic Grenade both heal her allies and damage her enemies; her sidearm tranquilizes key targets, 
and Nano Boost gives one of her comrades a burst of healing and a considerable increase in power and resiliency alike. 
One tip: learn how to juggle abilities so that they will be available when you truly need them in combat. 

-Jean-Baptiste Augustin-
Baptiste is a healer who was formerly a part of Talon, the anti-group of Overwatch. He has a primary fire with burst 
damage, and a secondary with grenade-launching heals. He has the ability to jump to high ground where accessible. His 
abilities allow him to place down an immortality field, where allies will never be killed until the field goes down, and 
his burst healing which can heal both himself and allies in the near area. His ultimate allows him to place a screen in 
front of his team. When shot through with damage, damage doubles. When healed through, healing doubles. Tip: When the 
game continues on, use immortality for destructive ultimate from the other team to protect your teammates. 

-Brigitte Lindholm-
Birgitte is a healer who was recently nerfed. Now, she has three health packs that she throws to her teammates and a 
shield with 200 health. Her primary is a mace, which is a ranged melee. 


-Lúcio Correia dos Santos-
Lucio is a healer focused on area healing. He has a switch between speed and healing, which would respectively give either 
speed or gradual healing to the teammates in his area. This ability has a boost option, which will temporarily give the 
teammates around him either a speed boost or faster healing, depending on the option he is switched to. His primary fire 
shoots waves of sound in burst, and his secondary fire allows him to push an enemy away or off a map. He has the ability 
to ride the walls around him. His ultimate gives 750 shield to his teammates who are around him. Tip: Save your ultimate 
for a suspecting enemy with a destructive ultimate.  

-Angela Ziegler-
Mercy is a main healer in Overwatch. Mercy’s Valkyrie Suit helps keep her close to teammates like a guardian angel so 
Mercy can heal, resurrecting or strengthening them with the beams emanating from her Caduceus Staff. Tip: use her evasive
abilities to stay alive and out of the way of enemy fire. 


-Moira O’Deorain-
Moria is an area hero with both the ability to heal teammates with her primary and healing orb options, and damage 
enemies with her secondary fire and her damage orb. Her primary shoots out a spray of healing, and her secondary is a 
beam-type damage dealer. She has the ability to fade, which will allow her to become invisible and dash away from any 
situation for a split second. Her ultimate allows her to project a beam, with both the ability to heal teammates and 
damage enemies. Tip: Learn to balance damage with healing. 

-Tekhartha Zenyatta-
Zenyatta is the least mobile of all of the healers without any add-ons. His primary fire allows him to throw his orbs at 
the enemy, and his secondary allows him to charge all of his orbs to deal more damage. He has an orb of discord of which 
he can cast upon the enemy, making them deal less damage and get hurt more easily. He also has an orb of harmony, which 
can be cast upon an ally to do gradual healing, as long as they are in his sight. His ultimate instantly heals the 
teammates in the immediate area, but they can still get one shot by, for example, a Widowmaker getting a headshot on a 
low health teammate. Tip: Only use Zenyatta’s ultimates for ultimates that cannot instantly kill your teammates.
